Hello, my name is Kris. My favourite piece of writing I have created would be a poem about what it is like to find the perfect person for you. I chose these one as I felt I was able to display a type of emotion and appreciation that is otherwise far too difficult to show.

The only person who has read it is my partner of three years, as it was technically written about us. Although, I kept it vague enough where if others were to read it, they would be able to relate. The poem was received so well that I ended up handwriting it for him, and he has it framed in his room.
